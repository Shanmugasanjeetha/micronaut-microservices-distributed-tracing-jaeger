As you have seen in this tutorial, without any annotations you get distributing tracing up-and-running fast with Micronaut.
We introduce the `@SpanTag` annotation. There are other annotations which will give you more flexibility:

- `@NewSpan` annotation will create a new span, wrapping the method call or reactive type.
- `@ContinueSpan` annotation will continue an existing span, wrapping the method call or reactive type.
